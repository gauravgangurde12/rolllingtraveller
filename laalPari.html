        <h1 class="blog-title">Laal Pari Adventures: A Family's Bumpy Ride to Pune</h1>

        <div class="post-content">
            
            

    <p>Hi guys, here's a story I want to tell you about—a trip to Pune. Diwali had just ended, and there was a ceremony my mom and dad were supposed to attend. I also wanted to go because I had college there, and the holidays were over.</p>

    <h2>The Night Journey Decision</h2>
    <p>We decided to travel by MSRTC bus, and the journey would be at night. We hadn't traveled by bus at night before because my dad doesn't like traveling at night. But since he had some work during the day, we were forced to travel at night. We initially planned to take a luxury bus, but then we read news that a luxury bus had caught fire on the same route just two days before. So, we were left with no other choice but to board the so-called "Laal Pari."</p>

    <h2>The Start of Our Journey</h2>
    <p>Before leaving home for the bus stop, I was trying to book a cab online but couldn’t find one. I was worried we wouldn’t get a cab in the middle of the night since we hadn’t traveled at that time before. So, we went to a nearby chowk and grabbed an auto from there. We finally arrived at the bus stop.</p>

    <p>As soon as we got off, we saw a bus heading to Pune, which had come from another city. Some seats were already occupied, but we rushed and grabbed seats at the back since the bus was about to leave. Once we were on board, we noticed many passengers had blankets, sweaters, and other items to protect themselves from the cold. We had sweaters and caps on, too.</p>

    <h2>Ticket Trouble & Conductor Confusion</h2>
    <p>The bus conductor soon started checking tickets. My mom and I sat in one seat, and my dad sat next to us with another passenger, who was surprisingly traveling to the same stop. The conductor came to my dad and asked for his ticket, as he had done with the other man. The conductor handed a ticket to the other man but didn’t give one to my dad.</p>

    <p>The conductor was confused and thought he had already given my dad a ticket. My dad asked for his ticket, but the conductor insisted that my dad already had one and that it was in his pocket. My dad knew he hadn’t been given the ticket, but he checked his pocket—no ticket.</p>

    <p>The conductor then called me to check the passenger list, and I told him that there was only one entry for three passengers, meaning that he had only issued one ticket—and it was to the other man, not us. Realizing his mistake, the conductor tried to print our tickets, but the machine malfunctioned. The entry was there, but no ticket came out.</p>

    <p>In a desperate move, the conductor printed a memo and handed it to us, pointing out the ticket combination for the three of us. We were a little confused since we hadn’t encountered this situation before, but we took the memo.</p>

    <h2>The Woman with the Same Problem</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, a lady on the bus had the same issue. She was upset because she needed a ticket to submit to her office for reimbursement. She argued with the conductor, but he was helpless. The officer at the next stop explained the situation to her, but she was adamant about needing the ticket. The matter escalated, and the officer told the woman to get off the bus if she wanted to get her money. She was ready to do that, but then another passenger stepped in and swapped their ticket for her receipt, and the issue was resolved.</p>

    <h2>The Bus Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The conductor was elderly, and many passengers were pointing out the woman’s mistake in how she had treated him. The bus then stopped for a tea break. Other buses heading to Pune had arrived before us, and they left before we could even get our tea.</p>

    <p>After a few hours, our bus continued. But then the driver noticed that one of the tires was punctured. Everyone thought it would take at least an hour or two to fix. The driver attempted to replace the tire with the spare, but he couldn’t fit the rod into the hole. The rod was too big for it to fit properly.</p>

    <p>So there we were, standing in the cold November winds at 2 AM, waiting for the puncture to be fixed. Fortunately, two other buses were on their way and could pick us up and drop us off in Pune. The first bus came, and a stampede of passengers from our bus rushed to get on. We had three bags, so it was hard to catch up. The first bus got full, and we had to wait in the cold.</p>

    <h2>Shivering in the Second Bus</h2>
    <p>Eventually, another bus came. My dad rushed forward and secured seats for us. When my mom and I made our way with the bags, there was barely any space to move because everyone’s luggage was blocking the aisles. We finally made it to our seats, but as soon as we sat down, I realized it was freezing. The window was left open, and the cold air was cutting through.</p>

    <p>I tried to close the window, but it was jammed. The bus was driving at 60 km per hour, and the cold air was relentless. My mom asked my dad to switch seats with me, so I sat in his spot, but even then, the cold breeze kept coming through. I locked the window, but the speed of the bus kept unlocking it.</p>

    <h2>Conductor Problems in the Second Bus</h2>
    <p>Now, the second bus conductor came around asking for tickets. My dad showed him the memo the previous conductor had given us. The new conductor was adamant that the memo wasn’t a valid ticket. He told us that if the machine broke, the conductor should have written the ticket on a blank piece of paper, but this memo didn’t count. There was a huge argument between my dad and the conductor, and the conductor insisted that we either get off the bus at the next stop or buy a new ticket.</p>

    <p>My dad stood firm and refused to get off. The conductor, frustrated, finally said, “Fine, the bus won’t go until you leave.”</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>And that’s how our adventure with the "Laal Pari" turned into one hilarious and frustrating night of misadventures. From faulty tickets to a punctured tire in the middle of nowhere, we sure had a journey to remember! Who knew that a simple trip could turn into a whole saga? Hopefully, the next time we travel by bus, it’s a bit less dramatic!</p>
