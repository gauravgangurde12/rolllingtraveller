        <h1 class="blog-title">First Day Follies: From Xerox Mishaps to Flush Fiascos</h1>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Your first job is always special. So is your first day.</p>
            
            <h2>First Day at the New Job: A Comedy of Errors</h2>
            <p>I arrived yesterday evening at Abhi's room in Akurdi. The next morning, we had to head to the office for the onboarding process.</p>

    <p>But here’s the twist: we went to the office, and it was at a completely different location than we expected.</p>

    <p>Before being called into the office, there was already an online training session underway, so we were already familiar with some of our colleagues.</p>

    <p>There were also some prerequisites for onboarding, such as bringing documents like our PAN card, Aadhaar card, and Covid vaccine certificates. We needed both photocopies and original documents. However, we didn’t have the photocopies! We figured we’d find a Xerox center nearby. But, of course, we got late on our very first day. Classic.</p>

    <p>To make matters worse, we had no clue about the route. We reached the office area, but we missed the turn and ended up driving ahead. The road was a one-way, so we couldn’t turn back. After traveling a kilometer, we had to loop back. It was 8:40 AM by then, and the traffic was already building up.</p>

    <p>After driving around for a while, we luckily found a Xerox shop open 2–3 kilometers away. It was a small Kirana store, and when we asked for prints, the shopkeeper wasn’t around—only “Didi” was there. She noticed we were in a hurry, but unfortunately, she didn’t know much about the printer. She offered to let us use the PC ourselves, which was our only option at that point.</p>

    <p>We tried to connect our phones to the computer, but we didn’t bring a data cable. We asked Didi for one, and she handed us a charging cable. But surprise! It didn’t transfer data, and to top it off, it gave us both a little shock. We quickly abandoned the cable and decided to log in to the system via Gmail. But then—another roadblock! The keyboard didn’t work properly; some keys were unresponsive. We scrambled to use the on-screen keyboard, and after some frantic typing, we finally got our prints by 8:56 AM. We rushed to the gate and arrived exactly at 9:00 AM.</p>

    <p>Once inside, we learned we had to generate a visitor’s card. There was a long queue, and people were just sitting around, waiting for hours. The best part? Some of the people there already knew me! There were some surprises along the way, too. We got our Welcome Kits, and I opened my salary account at XYZ Bank. There was a mini battle among bankers to open accounts, and I still remember Abhi opening his account at a different bank. We also bumped into Om, an old friend, who was working there.</p>

    <p>After taking a few pictures, we headed back home. On the way, the bike’s petrol ran out. We were stuck a little far from the nearest pump, so we had to walk and push the bike to the station. After refueling, we finally made it home. That evening, we received a joining email from another company, so we called Vipul to discuss the location and other details. He told us all the perks of being in his office, which was in Trivandrum. He even asked Abhi, “Do you eat veg or non-veg?” Abhi replied, “I eat both.” We laughed so hard at that.</p>

    <p>Later that evening, we went to the Ganesha temple for some spiritual respite, sang a few bhajans, and then visited the Hanuman temple since it was Hanuman Jayanti. The crowds were huge, but we managed to get Darshan and had a great meal afterward.</p>

    <h2>Day 2: The Struggles Continue</h2>

    <p>On day two at the company, we had to go to the Hinjewadi location. We were almost late again, as we were traveling nearly 20 kilometers through heavy traffic. We had never been there before, so we weren’t sure where the company was located. Thankfully, we made it on time. But just as I entered, I saw someone I <em>really</em> didn’t want to see. And that was only the beginning.</p>

    <p>We got our temporary IDs, and then we were handed our laptops. I got a ThinkPad (Lenovo), which had this cool scroll feature that the others didn’t have. Then came the task of configuring our laptops. But since we hadn’t received our official IDs yet, we had to wait for the third person to give us access.</p>

    <p>By lunchtime, we were starving. We went to the cafeteria and ordered a Thali for ₹95. We were shocked by the price, but later realized it was because of a ladoo included in the meal, costing ₹20. Not impressed with the food, though!</p>

    <p>We met a couple of Abhi’s friends, Y and K, and then went on a tour of the campus. We saw the gym, the courts, and other cool facilities. Back in our rooms, the ACs were blasting, which gave me a headache since I wasn’t used to such strong ACs.</p>

    <p>Then the configuration guy arrived and walked us through the steps. At one point, I and a colleague accidentally locked our accounts by entering the wrong password too many times. After some time, everything was fine. I connected the laptop to the LAN as instructed, but, surprise again—it didn’t work. My account eventually got unlocked, and I logged in successfully. But the struggle didn’t end there. The LAN cable was so stubbornly stuck in the laptop that we couldn’t remove it. Eventually, the staff member helped us, and we managed to disconnect it.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Abhi had an adventure of his own in the washroom. He tried to flush, but the flush wouldn’t stop running. He was terrified, but somehow, he managed to fix it. First day at the office and already a plumbing crisis!</p>

    <p>By the end of the day, we were pretty exhausted, but at least we got our IDs and access. I also got appointed as the CR (Class Representative), and it seemed like everything was going smoothly... until...</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

    <p>Your first job journey is filled with ups and downs, but these moments make for the best memories. From the Xerox mishap to the bathroom drama, I’m sure this will be a first day I’ll never forget.</p>
